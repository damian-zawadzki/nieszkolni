"I hoped we would make friends.
My husband always …. I consider sleep 
Why are you asking me about it?
 There is posibility I’ll fired.
It’s hard to get my child out of bed.
You could have told me the truth right away. I wouldn’t have got mad.
If you didn’t commit the crime, the police wouldn’t look for you now.
Who will cover for me when I take a week off?
You could’ve visited me yesterday if you were in town.
My friend and I are throwing a housewarming party this weekend."
